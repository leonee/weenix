in cleanup_child_proc()
    - pt_destroy_pagedir() is causing things to freak
      the fuck out. What should I do instead?

------------------------------------------------------------

in tty_create()
    - I'm bad at C. Is it okay to use dot notation?

in n_tty_read()
    - what to do if we're cancelled? Is this significant? 
    - is CTRL+D just not put in the buffer?

in do_operation()
    - In step 3:
        - is this the right number?
        - am I doing this right?

    - In step 9
        - what do we do with the error, if there is one?

in ata_intr()
    - Do I just call sched_wakeup_on()?

In general:
    - how do I test all of this?

in vfs_syscall functions
    - just want to clear up the mutex thing again
-------------------

in vmmap_map()
    - is it okay to not set vma->vma_vmmap before calling
      mmap? we're also told to set the vma_vmmap field
      in insert.
        - why the fuck not?
    - is it okay to have neither MAP_FIXED nor MAP_ANON, or both?

in do_fork()
    - does changing the regs_t actually change anything?
    - how does the reg struct get passed to userland_entry?
    - isn't the cwd set automatically?
    - how do we give two return values?

in *_put()
    - is what I'm doing w.r.t. unlinking stuff safe?
        - pframe_free!!!

In general:
    - wtf is this shadow daemon thing?

-------------------

Potential bugs:
    - if s5_write_file() ends early b/c of an error, the file 
      size is still as if the entire write suceeded

    - Address space before/after list in vmmap_find_range

in vfs_syscall functions
    - just want to clear up the mutex thing again

in s5_seek_to_block()
    - what to do if seekptr is great than file length
      and we're not allocating?
        - return 0
    - where do we use pin() and unpin()?
        - pin before pframe_dirty(), don't unpin until after

-------------------

in vmmap_map()
    - do we need to do anything about vma_olink here?
    - is it okay to not set vma->vma_vmmap before calling
      mmap? we're also told to set the vma_vmmap field
      in insert.

in anon_put()
    - what does it mean to uncache all of the object's pages?
      Flush them from the TLB?

in anon_lookuppage()
    - what should we return if we can't find the page?

in handle_pagefault()
    - are we supposed to flush the TLB after calling pt_map?

TODO 
    locking in s5fs.c :(
